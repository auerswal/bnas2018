# Building Network Automation Solutions Spring 2018

This is a repository for my solutions to hands-on assignments of the
[Building Network Automation Solutions](http://automation.ipspace.net/Main_Page)
course during spring of 2018.

* [Homework 1](hw1-the_lab/) - Build the Lab
* [Homework 2](hw2-reports/) - Create Summary Reports

Due to lack of time I have not attempted the remaining hands-on assignments.

I want to use this course to play with Ansible. The results can be found
in the [experiments](experiments/) folder.

* [Experiments](experiments/) - Ansible notes and experiments

In my opinion, proper use of automation leads to consistent results.
Consistent results are a prerequisite for consistent implementation quality.
Consistent implementation quality is a prerequisite for high implementation
quality.
To me, the reason to use automation is a goal of high quality.
Realizing a high quality implementation requires proper use of automation.
Consistentlty achieved high implementation quality provides a basis to
move fast without breaking things.
