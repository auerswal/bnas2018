# Experiments

I want to use the course to experiment with Ansible.

* [Ansible Nested Groups](ansible-nested-groups/) to avoid repetition in hosts files
* [Ansible Filter Namespace](filter_namespace/) tests whether there is global namespace pollution by filter plugins defining functions outside of the `FilterModule` class
